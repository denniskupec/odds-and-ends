I found this while cleaning out my drives. Some old thing to send messages on the Playstation Network. I didn't write this code, nor do I know who did. Don't even ask how it works, because I have even less of an idea about that. Something about reversing the Android app or something, I don't know. The project is missing the web api end and the original user had a problem with accounts getting banned fairly quickly. (I wonder why?)

That guy with the hair and iPhones comes to mind...  
Oh yeah: Sony, *don't sue me.*
